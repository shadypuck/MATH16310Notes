\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{3/30:}We can also do Exercise \ref{exr:12.6} with left- and right-handed limits, as defined in Additional Exercise 11.2.
    \item We can also do Exercise \ref{exr:12.7} by induction.
    \item \marginnote{4/1:}We can also do Theorem \ref{trm:12.13} by noting that of the left- and right-hand derivatives, one will be $\leq 0$ and the other $\geq 0$, but since they must be equal, they must equal 0.
    \item Include more rigorous restriction bits for Corollary \ref{cly:12.14} as a lemma?
    \item \marginnote{4/6:}Modify Theorem \ref{trm:12.13} with Lemma \ref{lem:11.8}.
    \item Redo Corollary \ref{cly:12.17}c as a direct proof?
    \item We don't have to be too rigorous with the restriction of $f$ in Corollary \ref{cly:12.17}. In fact, we need not even mention it.
    \item Include a bit more of the basic algebra proving that $h(a)=h(b)=0$ for Corollary \ref{cly:12.20}.
    \item Potentially for Theorem \ref{trm:12.21}, we can use $\varphi(y)$ but modified with $f^{-1}$ to prove the iffy limit transition.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Potentially we can apply the chain rule for this proof?
        \item Could we use the fact that $f$ is continuous to prove that as $x\to p$, $f(x)\to f(p)$?
    \end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{4/8:}The key to $\epsilon$-$\delta$ proofs is to find a way to get $|y-x|$ into the $|f(y)-f(x)|$ expression and then deal with the others.
    \item \marginnote{4/13:}Note that we can also prove Exercise \ref{exr:13.7} with the following procedure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lemma: If $f$ is uniformly continuous on two intervals $I,J$ whose union $I\cup J$ is also an interval, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $I\cup J$.
        \item Establish that $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$ using Theorem \ref{trm:13.6}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note that the continuity of $f$ on $[0,1]$ follows from the fact that $f$ is differentiable on $(0,1)\subset\R^+$ (Exercise \ref{exr:12.22}) by Theorems \ref{trm:12.5} and \ref{trm:9.10}.
            \item Note that the compactness of $[0,1]$ follows from Theorem \ref{trm:10.14}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Recall that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[1,\infty)$ from Exercise \ref{exr:13.3}.
        \item Apply the lemma.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
