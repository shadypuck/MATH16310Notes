\begin{theorem}\label{trm:14.1}\marginnote{\emph{5/4:}}
    Suppose that $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. Define $F:[a,b]\to\R$ by
    \begin{equation*}
        F(x) = \int_a^xf
    \end{equation*}
    If $f$ is continuous at $p\in(a,b)$, then $F$ is differentiable at $p$ and
    \begin{equation*}
        F'(p) = f(p)
    \end{equation*}
    If $f$ is continuous at $a$, then $F_+'(a)$ exists and equals $f(a)$. Similarly, if $f$ is continuous at $b$, $F_-'(b)$ exists and equals $f(b)$.
    \begin{proof}
        To prove that $F$ is differentiable at $p$ and $F'(p)=f(p)$, Definition \ref{dfn:12.1} tells us that it will suffice to show that $\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{F(p+h)-F(p)}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{F(p+h)-F(p)}{h}=f(p)$. We will tackle the right-handed limit first. To do so, Definition \ref{dfn:11.1} tells us that it will suffice to verify that for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $(p+h)\in[a,b]$ and $0<h<\delta$, then $|\frac{F(p+h)-F(p)}{h}-f(p)|<\epsilon$. Let $\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary. Since $f$ is continuous at $p$, Theorem \ref{trm:11.5} asserts that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $x\in[a,b]$ and $|x-p|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(p)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Choose this $\delta$ to be our $\delta$. Let $h$ be an arbitrary number satisfying $(p+h)\in[a,b]$ and $0<h<\delta$. Therefore,

            &= \left| \frac{1}{h}\int_p^{p+h}(f(x)-f(p))\dd{x} \right|\tag*{Theorem \ref{trm:13.24}}\\

            &< \epsilon

        The proof is symmetric for the left-handed limit. These proofs can also be applied to the endpoints.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}\label{rmk:14.2}
    Thus, we have that if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $F$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ and $F'(p)=f(p)$ for all $p\in[a,b]$ (where at the endpoints, we understand that the derivative should be interpreted as the one-sided derivative).
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:14.3}
    Suppose that $f:[a,b]\to\R$ is integrable and that $\Omega$ is a number satisfying $L(f,P)\leq\Omega\leq U(f,P)$ for all partitions $P$ of $[a,b]$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^bf = \Omega
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\int_a^bf\neq\Omega$. We divide into two cases ($\int_a^bf<\Omega$ and $\int_a^bf>\Omega$). If $\int_a^bf<\Omega$, then by Definition \ref{dfn:13.16}, $U(f)=\int_a^bf<\Omega$. It follows by Definition \ref{dfn:13.14} and \ref{lem:5.11} that there exists an object $U(f,P)\in\{U(f,P)\mid P\text{ is a partition of }[a,b]\}$ such that $U(f)\leq U(f,P)<\Omega$. But this contradicts the hypothesis that $U(f,P)\geq\Omega$ for all partitions $P$ of $[a,b]$. The argument is symmetric in the other case.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{trm:14.4}\marginnote{\emph{5/6:}}
    Let $f$ be integrable on $[a,b]$. Suppose that there is a function $G$ that is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ and such that $f=G'$ on $(a,b)$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^bf = G(b)-G(a)
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        To prove that $\int_a^bf=G(b)-G(a)$, Lemma \ref{lem:14.3} tells us that it will suffice to show that for all partitions $P=\{t_0,\dots,t_n\}$ of $[a,b]$, $L(f,P)\leq G(b)-G(a)\leq U(f,P)$. Let $P$ be an arbitrary partition of $[a,b]$. If $t_i,t_{i-1}$ are two sequential elements of $P$, then since $G$ is continuous on $[t_{i-1},t_i]\subset[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(t_{i-1},t_i)\subset(a,b)$, Corollary \ref{cly:12.16} asserts that there exists a point $\lambda\in(t_{i-1},t_i)$ such that $G(t_i)-G(t_{i-1})=G'(\lambda)(t_i-t_{i-1})$. It follows since $f=G'$ on $(a,b)$ that
        \begin{equation*}
            G(t_i)-G(t_{i-1}) = f(\lambda)(t_i-t_{i-1})
        \end{equation*}
        Thus, since we have proven the above statement for an arbitrary $i$, we can apply it to all $i$ and sum to get
        \begin{align*}
            \sum_{i=1}^nf(\lambda)(t_i-t_{i-1}) &= \sum_{i=1}^nG(t_i)-G(t_{i-1})\\
            &= G(b)-G(a)
        \end{align*}
        But by Definitions \ref{dfn:13.11}, \ref{dfn:5.7}, and \ref{dfn:5.6}, we have that $m_i(f)\leq f(\lambda)\leq M_i(f)$ for all $i$. It follows that
        \begin{equation*}
            \sum_{i=1}^nm_i(f)(t_i-t_{i-1}) \leq \sum_{i=1}^nf(\lambda)(t_i-t_{i-1})
            \leq \sum_{i=1}^nM_i(f)(t_i-t_{i-1})
        \end{equation*}
        Therefore, we have by Definition \ref{dfn:13.11} and substitution that
        \begin{equation*}
            L(f,P) \leq G(b)-G(a) \leq U(f,P)
        \end{equation*}
        as desired.
    \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cly:14.5}
    Let $f,g$ be functions defined on some open interval containing $[a,b]$ such that $f'$ and $g'$ exist and are continuous on $[a,b]$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^bfg' = [f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a)]-\int_a^bf'g
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on $[a,b]$, Exercise \ref{exr:12.9} implies that $fg$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with $(fg)'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. We now seek to prove that $f'g+fg'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$. By hypothesis, $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous on $[a,b]$. Additionally, since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on $[a,b]$, Theorem \ref{trm:12.5} asserts that they are continuous on $[a,b]$. Thus, since $f$, $g$, $f'$, and $g'$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, we have by consecutive applications of Corollary \ref{cly:11.10} that $f'g+fg'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. Consequently, by Theorem \ref{trm:13.19}, $f'g+fg'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, as desired. Furthermore, in a similar manner to the above, we can show that $f'g$ and $fg'$ are integrable on $[a,b]$. Lastly, it follows from the fact that $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$ by Corollary \ref{cly:11.10} that $fg$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\par
        Having established that $f'g+fg'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, that $fg$ is a function that is continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)\subset[a,b]$, and such that $f'g+fg'=(fg)'$ on $(a,b)$, and that $f'g$ and $fg'$ are integrable on $[a,b]$, we have that
        \begin{align*}
            \int_a^b(f'g+fg') &= (fg)(b)-(fg)(a)\tag*{Theorem \ref{trm:14.4}}\\
            \int_a^bf'g+\int_a^bfg' &= f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a)\tag*{Theorem \ref{trm:13.24}}\\
            \int_a^bfg' &= [f(b)g(b)-f(a)g(a)]-\int_a^bf'g
        \end{align*}
        as desired.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{cly:14.6}
    Let $g$ be a function defined on some interval containing $[a,b]$ such that $g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. Suppose that $g([a,b])\subset[c,d]$ and $f:[c,d]\to\R$ is continuous. Define $F:[c,d]\to\R$ by $F(x)=\int_c^xf$. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^bf(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\dd{x} = F(g(b))-F(g(a))
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        To prove that $\int_a^bf(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\dd{x}=F(g(b))-F(g(a))$, Theorem \ref{trm:14.4} tells us that it will suffice to show that $(f\circ g)\cdot g'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, $F\circ g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $(f\circ g)\cdot g'=(F\circ g)'$ on $(a,b)$. We will confirm each requirement in turn. Let's begin.\par
        To confirm that $(f\circ g)\cdot g'$ is integrable on $[a,b]$, Theorem \ref{trm:13.19} tells us that it will suffice to demonstrate that $(f\circ g)\cdot g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. By hypothesis, $f$ is continuous on $[c,d]$. Additionally, since $g'$ is defined on $[a,b]$, we know that $g$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, which implies by Theorem \ref{trm:12.5} that $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. The combination of the previous two results implies by Corollary \ref{cly:11.15} that $f\circ g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. This combined with the hypothesis that $g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ implies by Corollary \ref{cly:11.10} that $(f\circ g)\cdot g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\par
        To confirm that $F\circ g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, Corollary \ref{cly:11.15} tells us that it will suffice to demonstrate that $F$ is continuous on $[c,d]$ and $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. By Theorem \ref{trm:13.28}, $F$ is continuous on $[c,d]$. Additionally, we know by the above that $g$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\par
        To confirm that $F\circ g$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, Theorem \ref{trm:12.10} tells us that it will suffice to demonstrate that $F$ is differentiable on $(c,d)$ and $g$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$. Since $f$ is continuous on $(c,d)\subset[c,d]$, we have by Theorem \ref{trm:14.1} that $F$ is differentiable on $(c,d)$. Additionally, we know by the above that $g$ is differentiable on $(a,b)\subset[a,b]$.\par
        Since $F\circ g$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, we have by Theorem \ref{trm:12.10} again that $(F\circ g)'=(F'\circ g)\cdot g'$ for all $x\in(a,b)$. Thus, since $F'=f$ by Theorem \ref{trm:14.1}, we have that $(f\circ g)\cdot g'=(F\circ g)'$ on $(a,b)$, as desired.
